# Preface

Those documents specify the semantics of the Letlang programming language, as
well as the requirements for the implementation.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

The grammar of the language's features is described in those documents using
the [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) syntax.
