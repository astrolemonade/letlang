# Introduction

In the previous chapter, we learned about the `match` branching expression which
allows you to execute different branches of code using pattern matching.

Letlang provides some other control flow mechanisms:

 - conditional branching
 - loops
 - side effects
 - exceptions

This chapter will cover those mechanisms in detail.
