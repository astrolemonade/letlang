# Introduction

In this book, you will find a detailed description of **Letlang**, its syntax
and its features.

Since **Letlang** is still a work in progress &#128679;, this book is **NOT** a
tutorial.

You will not find setup instructions, or any compiler specification.

This book is intended for curious people and will describe what **Letlang** will
look like. The ideas exposed in this book are an aggregation of features found
in many existing languages, or features that are being implemented as we speak.

As a learning experience, I still would like to implement this language, even
if no one uses it. But this is certainly not my main priority.

This book is here as a record so those ideas can be confronted, challenged and
improved.
