# Who is this book for?

This book is intended for developers who wish to understand how Letlang is
designed.

Letlang is in an early stage, the design is quite finished and the
implementation is a work in progress. Anyone interested in the language might
find some interest in this book.

# What can you expect from this book ?

This book introduces the features of Letlang, their syntax, and some
implementation details.

Because Letlang is currently in the implementation phase, no more feature will
be added. This book is a good place to find out about those features, how they
work, and how to use them.

# What are not the goals of this book ?

This book is not a tutorial and does not provide any documentation about the
future standard library.

This book isn't a specification as well, but a first draft of the future
documentation.

If you are interested in the specification (also a work in progress), they are
currently being written as **[Letlang Enhancement Proposals](/lep)**.
