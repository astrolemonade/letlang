# Abstract

This LEP specifies the statements available in Letlang and their syntax.

# Rationale

Every expression<sup>[[1]](#ref-1)</sup> evaluates to a value, while
statements<sup>[[2]](#ref-2)</sup> perform actions and do not return any value.
Reducing the number of different kind of statements to a minimum gives more
freedom to the developer, and increase their ability to compose computations
together.

Letlang aims to provide only 6 statements, at the root of a module. Every other
concept is provided as an expression to use within those statements.

# Specification

## Module statement

This is the first statement of every Letlang module, it defines its name:

```letlang
module "foo.bar.baz";
```

## Import statement

This statement establish a dependency relation with another Letlang module, and
bring it into scope:

```letlang
import "foo.bar.baz";
# or
import "foo.bar.baz" as "foo";
```

## Constant definition

This statement creates a symbol associated to a single value:

```letlang
const pi = 3.14;
```

This statement is either:

 - **private:** only the current module can use it
 - **public:** modules importing the current module can use it

To define a public constant, prefix the statement with the `pub` keyword:

```letlang
pub const pi = 3.14;
```

## Class definition

This statement creates a new Letlang type<sup>[[3]](#ref-3)</sup>:

```letlang
class int(n: number) {
  frac(n) = 0;
}

class even(n: int) {
  n % 2 = 0;
}
```

This statement is either:

 - **private:** only the current module can use it
 - **public:** modules importing the current module can use it

To define a public class, prefix the statement with the `pub` keyword:

```letlang
pub class int(n: number) {
  frac(n) = 0;
}
```

## Function definition

This statement defines a new function<sup>[[4]](#ref-4)</sup>:

```letlang
func add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  a + b;
}
```

This statement is either:

 - **private:** only the current module can use it
 - **public:** modules importing the current module can use it

To define a public function, prefix the statement with the `pub` keyword:

```letlang
pub func add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  a + b;
}
```

## Effect definition

This statement defines the signature for a side effect<sup>[[5]](#ref-5)</sup>:

```letlang
effect log(msg: string) -> @ok;
```

This statement is either:

 - **private:** only the current module can use it
 - **public:** modules importing the current module can use it

To define a public effect, prefix the statement with the `pub` keyword:

```letlang
pub effect log(msg: string) -> @ok;
```

# Rejected Ideas

## Export statement

The usage of the keyword `pub` has been prefered over the usage of an explicit
`export` statement to reduce the number of lines of code in a module.
